           I have made many mistakes in life, and, when I am feeling disappointed in life or myself, I turn to Les Brown for inspiration.
            Les Brown is a successful business person and former politician that started from humble beginnings.
            Les was born with a twin brother in a low-income neighborhood in Miami, Florida.
            In school, he was known as D.T. the Dumb Twin, which damaged his self-image until a teacher told him never to let what people think about you define the person you are.
            Throughout his life, Les has had many setbacks and self-esteem issues, such as not being college-educated.
            But, he got out of his comfort zone, kept pushing forward, and trying things till something worked out for him.
            So, when life is looking down Les Brown reminds me that as long as you don't give up, you will be able to find a way to make life work.
